## Milestone 1 (7th April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

### Dataset

#### Composition

Our dataset is composed of 5 files and can be found in the [`data`](./data) folder. The different files are:
- [country_marine_protected_area.csv](./data/country_marine_protected_area.csv)
- [country_terrestrial_protected_area.csv](./data/country_terrestrial_protected_area.csv)
- [country_vulnerable.csv](./data/country_vulnerable.csv)
- [red_list_index_country_timeseries.csv](./data/red_list_index_country_timeseries.csv)
- [species.csv](./data/species.csv)
  
Those files are all CSV files and were downloaded on Kaggle from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnharshith/number-of-species-in-each-iucn-red-list-category) and [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sarthakvajpayee/global-species-extinction).

#### Description
Note that this dataset is, as specified and Kaggle, not official data but rather a new dataset created based on [IUCN Red List's](https://www.iucnredlist.org/) data.

The IUCN Red List is an indicator world’s biodiversity health. This tool is used to design and measure conservation action and policy and it helps inform conservation decisions. It regroups information about species’ range of distribution, population size, habitats and ecology, use and trade, threats, and conservation actions.

##### [Country marine protected area](./data/country_marine_protected_area.csv)
This file contains information about the size of marine protected areas in different countries. It includes
an evolution of those areas over time.

##### [Country terrestrial protected area](./data/country_terrestrial_protected_area.csv)
This file contains information about the size of terrestrial protected areas in different countries. It includes an evolution of those areas over time.

##### [Country vulnerable](./data/country_vulnerable.csv)
This file contains information about the vulnerable species in different countries and repartition of those species in different categories.

##### [Red list index country timeseries](./data/red_list_index_country_timeseries.csv)
This file contains the evolution of the red list index in different countries.

##### [Species](./data/species.csv)
This file contains information about the different species and their categories of vulnerability.


### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
